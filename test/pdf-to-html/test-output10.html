		<h1>SECTION 1. LEGISLATIVE INTENT.</h1>
		<p>It is the intent of the Legislature that prudent regulation of auxiliary containers is crucial to the welfare of Idaho&rsquo;s economy; that retail and food establishments are sensitive to the costs and regulation of auxiliary containers; and, that if individual political subdivisions of the state regulate such auxiliary containers, there exists the potential for confusing and varying regulations which could lead to unnecessary increased costs for retail and food establishments to comply with such regulations.</p>
